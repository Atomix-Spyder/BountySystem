The Marines are the seaborne military forces of the World Government, tasked with maritime law enforcement
 and naval warfare operations. They maintain a presence on all of the world's known seas, through countless 
branch offices; however, the vast majority of their forces are focused on the Grand Line, in which resides 
their base of operations, Marine Headquarters. Collectively, they stand as one of the Three Great Powers, 
albeit the "Strongest Ones".
