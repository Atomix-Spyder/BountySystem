Edward "Whitebeard" Newgate attempted
to rescue one of his commanders at the
Paramount war but was successfully 
stopped by combined efforts of the 
World Marines and it's subsidiaries.
His death was followed by the disbanding 
of the treacherous Whitebeard Pirates, 
most of whom are now in hiding or were
Killed In Action. Current Fleet Admiral
Akainu dealt the killing blow to 
treacherous Whitebeard.
