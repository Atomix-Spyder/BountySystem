Gold Roger, more oftenly known 
as the king of the pirates was 
finally apprehened by the efforts
of our hero, Vice Admiral Garp. 
He  was charged with many accounts
 of piracy and was executed by 
the World Marines on the island of 
Loguetown, in East Blue Ocean. His 
execution has heavily affected the 
influx of Pirates in the new age.
His whole crew has been in hiding for
the last 25 years now.
