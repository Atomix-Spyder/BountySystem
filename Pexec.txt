Portgas Ace was executed at the marine 
HQ, Marineford. He was the son of Gold
Roger and served as a commander of
Whitebeard enacting his evil deeds for
him. The execution was distrupted by
WB pirates to rescue Portgas, but was
conclusively unsuccessful and resulted
in death of Whitebeard himself. A massive
force of 100,000 marines and 50 SSG class
battle-ships were put up to this task.
